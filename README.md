Hello there!

I'm UrgellMossley a normal guy with a passion for coding, and web development. I have been learning basic web development on and off for the past year or so, and created this repository as a way to monior and share my progress.

My aim is to become a full stack web developer. I love working to create interactive and creative web apps, furthermore I am beginning to learn how we can leverage the power of Javasript via Node JS to create our own web servers.

I am always tinkering on something, so when I create or leaen about something cool I pop it up here. If you have any questions or comments I'd be delighted if you got in touch!

For now, thank you and enjoy your vist :)
